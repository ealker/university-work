## Past Paper Practice 

### Question 1: "This question concerns the use of linked data structures in ANSI C. You must not use facilities that only exist in C++. 

It has been decided that a linked list will be used to store the brand and model names of the cars available at a car showroom and their prices.
Each node of the linked list is required to hold a carâ€™s brand and model names (each with a maximum length of 30 characters) and their price recorded to the nearest pound, along with other appropriate fields to link the nodes together as a linked list.
The list must be ordered such that the most expensive car should be closest to the head of the list, the cheapest at the end and the others in between in an appropriate order from most expensive to cheapest.
You are required to write some sections of a program that will use this linked list as specified below."
